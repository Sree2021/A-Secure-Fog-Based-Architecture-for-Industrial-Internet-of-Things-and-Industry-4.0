# A-Secure-Fog-Based-Architecture-for-Industrial-Internet-of-Things-and-Industry-4.0
This repo contains the implementation code for the paper [A Secure Fog Based Architecture for Industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9102442)

The folder Aggregate_BLS contains our proposed code written in Python whereas the folder BLS contains the code of the comparing scheme, written in Python as well. Both the folders contain separate executable files for the Fog nodes and IoT device respectively.

The folder Secure Data Sharing contains our proposed code written in C. It contains executable files for PKG, Fog node, IoT device and
User respectively.
