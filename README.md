# A-Secure-Fog-Based-Architecture-for-Industrial-Internet-of-Things-and-Industry-4.0
It contains the codes used in the paper for experimentation. The manuscript has been accepted for publication in a future issue of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics.

The folder Aggregate_BLS contains our proposed code written in Python whereas the folder BLS contains the code of the comparing scheme
which is also written in Python. Both the folders contain separate executable files for the Fog nodes and IoT device respectively.

The folder Secure Data Sharing contains our proposed code written in C. It contains executable files for PKG, Fog node, IoT device and
User respectively.
